# R Refresher

This tutorial is design for R users who have stepped away from the platform for a while and now want to get back to it. In this workshop you will learn how to:

* Use RStudio
* Import and manipulate data
* Create basic plots
* Write an R script
* Aggregate and summarize data
* Import and use packages
* Read documentation and get more help

We will use an R Markdown document to go through examples from the topics above.

## Prerequisites
